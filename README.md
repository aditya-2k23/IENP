## Problem Statement Number - 86

### Problem Title - Chatbot based helpdesk for govt employees and departments

### Project Idea

Government employees and departments often encounter challenges in navigating various processes of general
business
nature, such as procurement, implementation, authority issues, and receiving directions. However, they lack a
centralized and efficient support system to address these issues promptly.
To address these challenges, a centralized and department-wise chatbot-based help-desk system should be
developed. This
chatbot will serve as an interactive platform where government employees can seek assistance, guidance, and
clarification on various processes and procedures. It will offer a user-friendly interface accessible to
employees
across different departments, enabling them to quickly resolve queries and streamline their workflow.

### Project Details

**Increase Productivity:** By providing immediate assistance and guidance, the chatbot help-desk
will reduce the
time
employees spend on resolving queries manually. This will enhance overall productivity within government
departments.

**Increase Inter-department Coordination:** The centralized nature of the chatbot help-desk will
facilitate
seamless
communication and collaboration among different departments. Employees can easily share information, seek
advice, and
coordinate efforts, leading to more efficient workflow and better decision-making.

**Increase Job Satisfaction:** Access to a reliable support system will improve job satisfaction
among
government
employees.
They will feel supported in their roles, leading to higher morale and motivation. Indirectly, citizens will
also
benefit
from improved services and streamlined processes, enhancing overall satisfaction with government services.

By implementing a centralized chatbot-based help-desk, government departments can overcome common
operational
challenges,
enhance efficiency, and ultimately deliver better services to citizens while boosting employee satisfaction.
